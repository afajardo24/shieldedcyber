I am a highly motivated cybersecurity analyst, who is eager to help identify and prevent factors and vulnerabilities that could put the assets of an organization and its people at risk.
I place a high importance in maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and avoid risk to the organization and the people.
